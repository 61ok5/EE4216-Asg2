# EE4216-Asg2: Spring Boot Vue2 Todo App

This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks in a todo list. The backend is built with Spring Boot and Maven, using RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on the todo list. The frontend is built with Vue2, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the todo data.
